\subsection{Additional Experimental Results}
We also conducted an additional experiments where we generated a training set $\hat{T}_{train}$ with only $2$ trajectories with $10$ states for every domain. To generate this dataset, we produced heuristic plan by considering the $2$ most complex problem settings (in terms of number of objects) adopted for generating the training set with $10$ trajectories for every domain.

% RONI: I HOPE YOU ALSO SLEEP SOMETIME ;)

% Yes soon I think.. But you too

% I'm close to converging also, but I want to submit a first version before. Close to it. 
% One thing if we're "talking" to note: I changed the flow a bit in the experimental results so its something like: (1) here's a general way to evaluate model learningn using our metrics, (2) and here's how we impelmented it ( putting here all the details like the planner configuration and all that). I already did this change, just writing so  you're not surprised or annoyed when you read it (after sleeping of course). Hope that's Ok?

% Awesome sure, thanks for saying it (but I think I would not realized it), so I am also converging with the supplementary material (and additional exp with 2 traces), tomorrow morning will polish the code so that we can submit also that

% SOUNDS Great (need to figure out how to anonymize it, but I know there are ways to do it)

% Yes i usually upload the git repo zip by removing the ".git" folder (whichh stores e.g. commit with username etc.)

% Super! TNX

% you too and good night :)
